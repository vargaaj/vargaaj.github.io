            <p>
              This class offered a comprehensive foundation in the principles of
              parallel systems, coupled with hands-on experience in a wide array
              of both classical and contemporary methods for managing and
              leveraging concurrency. It covered essential topics such as shared
              memory synchronization, the architecture of parallel systems like
              GPUs, and explored distributed parallel frameworks, providing a
              deep understanding of the techniques used to optimize performance
              in modern computing environments.

                The goal of this project was to gain exposure to using
                programming tools that leverage language-level type systems to
                manage concurrency and provide safety guarantees. We implemented
                2PC across multiple processes communicating with each other
                using the inter-process communication offered by the ipc-channel
                crate.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                In this project, we implemented an astrophysical N-body
                simulation using the Barnes-Hut algorithm in C++ with MPI
                (Message Passing Interface) to enable parallel computation. The
                Barnes-Hut algorithm is an efficient O(n log n) solution for
                N-body problems, leveraging a hierarchical tree structure to
                approximate gravitational forces between celestial bodies. Our
                implementation involved constructing a quadtree (for 2D
                simulation) to spatially partition the system and compute force
                interactions based on the Multipole Acceptance Criteria (MAC).
