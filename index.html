          <h3>Android Programming</h3>
          <div class="project-description">
            <p>
              In this class, we studied Android APIs and learned to build
              significant Android applications. The course had a practical
              focus, with significant in-class programming, programming
              assignments and a large project. The course was taught entirely in
              Kotlin. While the course focuses on Android, we learned general
              principles of software engineering and mobile app development.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                The idea for the game is that the user clicks a button and a
                sequence of English words appears in the area under the button.
                Also, each word appears individually (with a light grey
                background) in the game area, splayed out pretty randomly. You
                have to click each word in the sequence order in the time
                allotted. If you click a word out of order, the word flashes
                red. If you click all the words in the correct order, the game
                ends and you get points.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                This project involves developing an interactive Android game
                with two modes: Jump and Fling. The Jump mode requires a puck to
                move between four predetermined positions upon user interaction,
                ensuring precise alignment with the game area's borders. The
                Fling mode introduces physics-based movement where the puck must
                be flung into a randomly selected green goal border within a
                countdown timer to score points. The puck follows realistic
                motion with friction and elastic collisions upon hitting
                non-goal borders. The application maintains state persistence
                when switching between modes and is built as a single-activity
                Android application.

              This class offered a comprehensive foundation in the principles of

              of both classical and contemporary methods for managing and
              leveraging concurrency. It covered essential topics such as shared
              memory synchronization, the architecture of parallel systems like
              GPUs, and explored distributed parallel frameworks, providing a
              deep understanding of the techniques used to optimize performance
              in modern computing environments.

                In this project, we implemented an astrophysical N-body

                (Message Passing Interface) to enable parallel computation. The

                N-body problems, leveraging a hierarchical tree structure to
                approximate gravitational forces between celestial bodies. Our

                simulation) to spatially partition the system and compute force
                interactions based on the Multipole Acceptance Criteria (MAC).
