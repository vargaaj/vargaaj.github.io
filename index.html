              Locksmith is a password management application that is used to
              store, update, and delete passwords and their associated
              information in a quick and secure manner. This app was built for
              my final project in my Android Programming graduate course. Please

            <p>
              In this class, we studied Android APIs and learned to build
              significant Android applications. The course had a practical
              focus, which included programming assignments and a large project.
              The course was taught entirely in Kotlin. While the course focuses
              on Android, we learned general principles of software engineering
              and mobile app development.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                This project involves developing an interactive Android game
                with two modes: Jump and Fling. The Jump mode requires a puck to
                move between four predetermined positions upon user interaction,
                ensuring precise alignment with the game area's borders. The
                Fling mode introduces physics-based movement where the puck must
                be flung into a randomly selected green goal border within a
                countdown timer to score points. The puck follows realistic
                motion with friction and elastic collisions upon hitting
                non-goal borders. The application maintains state persistence
                when switching between modes and is built as a single-activity
                Android application.

                The idea for the game is that the user clicks a button and a

                Also, each word appears individually (with a light grey
                background) in the game area, splayed out pretty randomly. You
                have to click each word in the sequence order in the time
                allotted. If you click a word out of order, the word flashes
                red. If you click all the words in the correct order, the game
                ends and you get points.

                2PC across multiple processes communicating with each other
                using the inter-process communication offered by the ipc-channel
                crate.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                In this project, we implemented an astrophysical N-body
                simulation using the Barnes-Hut algorithm in C++ with MPI
                (Message Passing Interface) to enable parallel computation. The
                Barnes-Hut algorithm is an efficient O(n log n) solution for
                N-body problems, leveraging a hierarchical tree structure to
                approximate gravitational forces between celestial bodies. Our
                implementation involved constructing a quadtree (for 2D
                simulation) to spatially partition the system and compute force
                interactions based on the Multipole Acceptance Criteria (MAC).
